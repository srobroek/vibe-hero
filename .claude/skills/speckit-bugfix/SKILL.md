# Bug Fix

Structured loop: **triage -> diagnose -> scope -> fix -> verify**. Max 3 loops.

## Phases

1. **Triage**: Parse input (issue, stack trace, or description). Gather context in parallel. Classify P0-P3. Present Bug Context Card. Ensure GitHub issue for P0/P1.
2. **Diagnose**: Reproduce (failing test, code trace, error search). Check `git log` on affected files. Form 1-3 ranked hypotheses. Confirm with user.
3. **Scope**: Score complexity 0-6 (files, lines, tests, behavior, blast radius, spec context). Route: 0-2 Quick Fix, 3-4 Structured Fix, 5-6 Full Spec.
4. **Fix**: Quick = direct edit + repro test. Structured = scratch report + implement. Full Spec = iterate on active spec or new micro-spec (completed specs are never reopened).
5. **Verify**: Repro test passes. Regression suite green. Diff review clean. Build and linter pass. On failure: back to Diagnose. Loop 3: expand scope or abandon.

## Rules

- NEVER skip Triage or Verify, even for obvious fixes.
- P0/P1 MUST have a GitHub issue for traceability.
- Side-issues: P0/P1 pause current fix, P2/P3 defer with issue.
- Store non-obvious root cause patterns to long-term memory. Skip trivial fixes.
